Current solutions:
- Allows 4 types of highlight.
- Nice and clicky
- Very slightly reduced lag with "element" variable, instead of a DOM search every time

Problems:
- Have to manually type all the info in onclick function call
- Border has to have a border before it's styled
- Only one "type" can be called at a time (so you can't do text and background at the same time)
